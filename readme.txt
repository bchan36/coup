Name: Coup
Coup is a strategy game based on the actual card game “Coup.” This will be a single-player playing against several computer players. Each player receives 2 cards and two coins at the beginning. Coins can pay for certain actions. Each card has 1 of 5 roles on them and each role has actions that they can legally do. The players go in turn and choose an action. The players can lie and pretend they can do a certain action but other players can accuse them of lying. The goal of the game is to be the last one with cards. Players can lose cards by falsely accusing other players of lying, being accused, assassination, or coup.
